# Face clustering at La Liberté

This repository contains the code used to conduct all the experiments for the
master thesis "Deep learning face clustering at La Liberté: an exploratory pipeline".

## Usage

face_clustering_pipeline.py is the main script to run the pipeline, see main for
example usage.

All iterative algorithms are implemented in the iterative_clustering/iterative_clustering.py file.

N.B. some path might be broken in the code, please adapt them to your needs.
